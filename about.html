		With nearly fifteen years of experience in New York City real estate, a hit TV show, and a New York Times bestseller, Fredrik

		first apartment in 2004. Since then, heâ€™s become the face of Million Dollar Homes New York and a trusted celebrity realtor,
		selling homes to Cameron Diaz, John Legend, and Daniel Craig, among others. His secrets to success are recorded in The
		Sell: The Secret of Selling Anything to Anyone.
