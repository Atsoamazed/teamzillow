      "review_text": "Fatemah was very helpful throughout the whole process of my partner and I looking to buy a house and she made our dreams come true.  She was very responsive with questions and concerns we had.  Throughout the whole process, she's guided us with the best house that fit out needs.  The location is comfortable, quiet, and friendly.  She has been an extreme help with showing and negotiating.  The whole process was a smooth transition even through the stressful parts.  Her knowledge about the house was excellent, even if there was some unanswered questions she would get as much information and detail she can and return an answer by the same of following day.  She ordered all the proper inspections needed to insure our safe purpose.  Her team she works with are super awesome! I would highly recommend Fatemah to those who are seeking to purchase or sell a house.  Her quality of customer service is excellent! Once again, thank you for all your help, patience, and support. \nKind Regards, \nKyle and Rhoddavie\n",

She literally did not rest until we had our house. It felt like she had no other clients but us (which I'm sure was not the case!). She is dedicated and assertive and gets things done. We couldn't even keep up. We couldn't have asked for a better realtor. Thanks Fatemah!!!\n",
