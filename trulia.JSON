       review_text: 'When it comes to working with brokers, Erin is the best.  Hands-down.  Not only does she know the NYC market inside and out but she is a shrewd negotiator and extremely personable.  She\'s very upfront about advising on whether or not you should pursue a property (at the price or at all) and is very thoughtful with her comps analysis.  Lastly, and probably the best part, is she is not one of those pushy New York brokers.  She let\'s you breathe and consider your options and makes sure you have all the info you need to make the best decision you can.\n',

He possesses  a vast and detailed knowledge of what the market has to offer combined with a truly exceptional ability to listen to and assess his clientsâ real estate needs.  He found me the home I had dreamed of.  Alexanderâs passion and talent for real estate sales make him a formidable advocate on his clientsâ behalf.\n',

I had trouble beforehand in trying to find an apartment by myself but it only took Alexander a few moments to recognize which layout and location would be ideal (seriously this guy knew about apartments I couldnât find and he brought them out like a hat trick). When it comes to my next real estate endeavors itâs Alexander all the way.\n',

He took the time to understand what I was looking for in an apartment (including some of my unrealistic, Midwestern expectations). He quickly arranged a large number of great potential options and helped me weigh the trade-offs of the best among them. In a matter of a few days, I ended up with a great place that delivered far more than I was looking for. Knowledgeable, hard-working, and personable - Jordan was a pleasure to work with!\n',
