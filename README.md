Who is Team Zillow?
Aderiana, Amy, Anita, Caprice, Erin, Nora and Shanice!
The Problem
A Real Estate Agent wants all their client Reviews from various websites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com to be collected and placed on their own individual website.
The Solution
Team Zillow made the Real Estate Agents’ dream come true by using an API to move the Agent’s reviews on Zillow to their own personal website which was also developed by Team Zillow.
The API: Reviews from Zillow to Real Estate Agent Personal Website
Tools Used: API called ReviewScraper
Code Languages used: Javascript, JSON, HTML, CSS
The Process: Scraped data (specifically reviews) from Zillow’s page for a specific realtor and pushed it to their personal website as individual blog posts. The website itself was built using HTML and CSS.
